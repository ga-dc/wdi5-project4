# Project 4

## Pièce de Résistance

Project 4... It's here. This is your opportunity to show employers what you're really made of. This project should be representative of you and your newly garnered skill set.

## Hard Requirements
NONE!

Ultimately, this project is for you and you alone. That being said, you should use this as an outlet to feature the different things you are capable of/want to highlight.
- If you want employers to notice you for your rad front end skillz, maybe utilize backbone and some fancy jQuery plugins while keeping your back end minimal.
- Should you go the opposite route and want to go crazy with your domain model and incorporate several complex multi-model associations, that's awesome too!
- You can also take the road between and have a bit of everything. (Also awesome!!)

Don't forget, we're looking for evidence of comprehension of the material we've taught. So no matter which route you take, do your best work! Be sure to check out the [rubric](/rubric.md).

## Examples

Here is a collection of past WDI projects - http://gallery.ga.co/WDI

## Pairing

You may work in pairs to complete this project. However, if you do, the standards for graduation will be raised: You may not receive **any** "does not meet expectations", and must receive at least one "exceeds expectations".

See here for the standards otherwise:

## Checkpoints
> These will be updated throughout the next two weeks, so be sure to check for updated checkpoints

### Tuesday HW (26 May)
SUBMIT a three-sentence, 30-second pitch of your project idea as an issue to THIS repo before 9:00 AM Wednesday.

### Wednesday HW (27 May)
- Create a repo for your project
- Create a folder in your project repo called `planning`. Place the following in it:
  - A markdown file that contains 5 user stories
  - Pictures of sketches/wireframes
    - Have at least 3 views wireframed
    - If your app is a single page application, create at least 3 wireframes of your single page application at different states

### Thursday HW (28 May)
Create an ERD for your project. Incorporate all the models you expect to use, and also all the fields (columns) you expect each model to have.

This can be made on LucidChart.com, drawn by hand, sketched on a whiteboard... However, a photo or screenshot of the completed ERD must be included in your project repo.

As an issue to **THIS** repo, submit a link to the image of the ERD within your repo's file system. (That is, the domain of the link should be `Github.com`, not `Imgur.com` or something.)

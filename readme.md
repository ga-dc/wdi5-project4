# Project 4

## Pièce de Résistance

Project 4... It's here. This is your opportunity to show employers what you're really made of. This project should be representative of you! It should be what you show people that exemplifies the newly garnered skills you want to showcase.

## Hard Requirements
NONE !!!!!

Ultimately, this project is for you and you alone. That being said, you should use this as an outlet to feature the different things you are capable of/want to highlight.
- If you want employers to notice you for your rad front end skillz, maybe utilize backbone and some fancy jQuery plugins while keeping your back end minimal.
- Should you go the opposite route and want to go crazy with your domain model and incorporate several complex multi-model associations, that's awesome too!
- You can also take the road between and have a bit of everything.( Also awesome!! )
